Hi Nicholas,

I was the cartoonist at the company picninc.  It was a pleasure meeting you and your family, and learning about Castelion.  I was particularly impressed by your CEO's candor and sense of purpose.  It felt good to be amongst people with a shared mission and esprit de corps.  I'd be eager to learn more about what I could do for a company like yours.  I'm completing my MBA at UCI with a focus on Ai, competitive analytics, and data-driven management.  I have a degree in CS from Columbia and an enthusiasm for hacking, tinkering and wearing many hats.  I can even draw.  Can we talk more?

I sent you a preview of my newsletter Gekko's Birthday -- news and insights that can change your life:  scottgross.works/gekko

  "title": "Castelion Disrupts Defense",
  "summary": "Castelion, a Torrance-based defense startup founded by former SpaceX executives, is raising a $350 million Series B round to scale production of hypersonic missiles. The company has secured DoD support for development of Blackbeard Ground Launch (GL) — an “affordable, mass-produced” hypersonic weapon designed to deliver around 80% of the capability of current long-range systems at lower cost.",
  "tags": ["Castelion", "hypersonic", "SpaceX", "Series B", "defense", "manufacturing"],
  "category": "Warfare",
  "take": "Castelion's founders bring fast iteration, frequent testing, lean production and vertical integration into a defense sector traditionally dominated by slow, risk-averse legacy primes. Long, capital-intensive dev cycles and fragmented supply chains also hamstring shipbuilding, commercial airplanes, heavy equipment and especially home building. Just as SpaceX dethroned Boeing/Lockheed in space launch and Tesla disrupted autos, Castelion's model hints at a broader manufacturing realignment.",

  "title": "Tariffs Not the Problem",
  "summary": "President Trump threatened to impose tariffs of approximately 100% on semiconductors not built in the U.S. In response, NVIDIA pledged to invest up to $500 billion in U.S. AI infrastructure over four years. Apple committed another $100 billion in U.S. investment, including $2.5 billion for manufacturing in Kentucky. Analysts doubt these pledges will meaningfully shift manufacturing away from Asia.",
  "category": "Markets",
  "tags": ["NVIDIA", "Trump", "Tariffs", "Semiconductors", "China", "TSMC"],
  "take": "NVIDIA is too-important to fail, but the ground trembles beneath them. TSMC is vulnerable to China. 87% of revenue comes from data centers, at a time when hyperscalers are either cutting back or building their own chips. By the time export bans or tariffs are lifted, China, Amazon, and Google won't need NVIDIA anymore.",

I noticed you didn't Subscribe to Gekko's Birthday from the preview I sent you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice you didn't get rich like me, Gordon Gekko.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm talking talking *liquid*. Rich enough to have your own jet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich enough not to waste time.&nbsp;&nbsp;$50, $100 million dollars, buddy. A player.

Summary: 

An industry-wide focus on performance per dollar and per watt is fundamentally rewriting every IT framework to meet the demands of generative AI.  This includes specialized hardware like GPUs, ASICs, and TPUs, new network interconnects (NVLink, ICI), high-bandwidth memory, and ultra-dense, energy-efficient data centers.  The transition will require rapid, large-scale deployments of homogeneous hardware, where fault tolerance, power management and security are paramount.
